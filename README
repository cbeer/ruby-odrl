ruby-odrl is a ruby library for creating and evaluating Open Digital Rights Language (<http://odrl.net>) documents as a policy decision point.

USAGE

This library provides a framework for the parsing and evaluation of ODRL XML documents. Support for non-XML documents may happen in the future. This library, however, does not provide an out-of-the-box solution for rights management -- to implement the library, you must develop the inputs to the decision engine, which includes the user/party implementation, policy execution, and error handling. Finally, instead of returning a binary policy decision, this library uses exceptions to communicate back error messages (which may be caught by implementors to provide contextually relevant errors and actions).

Example implementations are provided in the examples/ directory, which includes a very basic Blacklight integration.
